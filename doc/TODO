There are a lot TODOs ... so if you are interested, drop us a mail.

- Use autoconfigure (?)
  I've never done a bigger software project, so I'm a noob here...
- Better documentation (could always be better)
- Debugging
- Management Scripts, debian package

- iPass support
- Event login
- eduroam iteroperability

- Get specification of XML RPC (There is no, at least Monzoon has no ... See
  the xml-rpc-server.py for "me version of the specification")
