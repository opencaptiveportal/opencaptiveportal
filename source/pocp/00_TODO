Landingpage:
- Programm give_internet for Conference Login
- Get the listen ip address for xml-rpc from fqdn from ssl cert

- install routine
- (traffic) statistics (-> ntop ?)


To test:
- route.php 
- back.php


Nice to have:
- IPv6 cabability: The WISPs are maybe not able to offer IPv6 connectivity. In
  this case we can use teredo. 
  TODO: 
  - Django has no IPv6 data type/field -> we have to expand the models.
  - Document, what is necessary for Teredo. And implement it.
